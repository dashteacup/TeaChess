TeaChess
=========

A two person Java chess application.

This app supports all legal chess moves, including special cases such
as castling, en passant, and pawn promotion. The game provides the
option to highlight legal moves when a chess piece is selected, which
can be disabled via the options menu. Games continue until they reach
checkmate or stalemate.

History
=========

I primarily wrote this for learning purposes. It had been a while
since I last wrote code in Java, so I opened up this old project and
filled out the missing parts. It gave me an opportunity to apply
Object Oriented design and experiment with writing a GUI in Swing. I
also learned a bunch about the game of chess, including many rules
that I never knew about (or forgot).
